This is where thread hits the road. Let's try to build an experiment for checking the theory.

## M-alpha-0: Recipe of Life

Focusing on the [hydrothermal vents example]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2022-02-26-starting-point %}), we could build a simulation of particles in limited space. We'd need some of the following components:

  - energy transfer, or chemical reactions. There should be a law of energy conservation in place for each mini-interaction. Yet there needs to be some energy source globally.
  - some force of the [3rd law of thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_law_of_thermodynamics), like erosion.
  - space where things can move and group together, like water.
  - different kinds of matter (rock, energy, and something active).

The idea is that once we set this process up, the active form of matter will eventually start self-organizing, similar to [Millerâ€“Urey experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Urey_experiment). Of course, there are still many unknowns to this: what types of matter, how they interact, and how the physics works in this system.
